# 👋 Hello, World! I'm Allen Amaya

## 💻 Software Engineer | 🌐 Web Developer | 🐶 Dog Dad | 🎭 Aspiring Voice Actor

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Grab a ☕ (or your beverage of choice) and let me tell you a bit about myself.

### 🚀 Quick Facts

- 🎓 Graduate of Moringa School's Software Engineering program
- 🏗️ Building digital dreams one line of code at a time
- 🐾 Proud dog dad to two furry debuggers
- 🎙️ Aspiring voice actor (I do a mean Yoda impression, I do)
- 📚 Currently studying AWS to become a solutions architect (because the cloud is where it's at!)
- 🚴 Cycling enthusiast (I pedal my way through bugs)
- 📝 Poetry aficionado (Roses are red, violets are blue, I love coding, how about you?)

### 💼 Professional Journey

I've worn many hats in my tech journey (and not just to hide my bad hair days):

- 🧪 Front-end Developer at Savannah Informatics: Where I learned that mixing code is way more fun than mixing chemicals
- 🎨 UI/UX Designer at iTalanta: Because making buttons pretty is an art form
- 💻 Software Engineer Intern at iTalanta: Where I turned coffee into code and dreams into reality

### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

Here are some of the tools I juggle (sometimes literally):

- JavaScript (ES6+) - Because who doesn't love a good callback joke?
- TypeScript - For when JavaScript needs to put on its serious pants
- React - Making UIs as reactive as my dog when I say "walk"
- Angular - For when I'm feeling a bit more acute
- Node.js - Server-side JavaScript, because why stop at the browser?
- Ruby on Rails - For when I'm feeling a bit fancy
- HTML/CSS - The peanut butter and jelly of web development
- Git - Where I commit to my relationships with my code

### 🌟 Featured Projects

1. **Hotel Hopper**: A web app that helps you hop from hotel to hotel. It's like Tinder, but for finding a place to sleep.
2. **Friendzone**: A social networking site that puts you right where you don't want to be. Ouch!
3. **Shopcrawl**: An e-commerce platform for arachnids. Just kidding, it's for humans who shop like they're crawling the web.

### 📚 Current Learning Adventure

I'm currently on a quest to conquer the AWS cloud. Soon, I'll be architecting solutions so high in the cloud, I'll need an oxygen mask!

### 🎭 Voice Acting Dreams

When I'm not coding, I'm practicing my voice acting. My specialty? Error message narration. "404: Page not found" has never sounded so dramatic!

### 🚴 Cycling Adventures

I love cycling almost as much as I love coding. It's the perfect way to debug my code mentally while working on my calves physically. Win-win!

### 📝 Poetic Musings

Here's a little poem I wrote about coding:

Roses are red,
Violets are blue,
I love coding,
And debugging too.
